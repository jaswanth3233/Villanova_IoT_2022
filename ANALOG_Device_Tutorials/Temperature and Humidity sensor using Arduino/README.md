# Testing temperature and Humidity Sensor by using Arduino Software

The process is same as the wiringpi, but there will be slight changes in the circuit diagram and we re going to use the ESP32.

## Hardware Requirements

* DHT11 Sensor 
* Breadboard
* ESP32-WROVER
* 4 jumper cables ( Male to Male)
* Resistor 10k ohm's

## Software Requirements

-> Download the Arduino IDE from the website : https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
-> And
