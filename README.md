# Villanova_IoT_2022

Hello, my name is Jaswanth Sunkara.I am a Graduate student at Villanova University.

# Motivation

GitHub is the best repository to store and keep track of all my work so that I can refer and share it with others at any time in the near future. This shared information regarding my IoT project may aid others in accessing my repository and extracting my code, procedures, etc. for utilizing it for their ideas in the same field and also suggesting me more optimal solutions if any.
