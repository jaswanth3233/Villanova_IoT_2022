# controlling the light by using the switch implementing using Arduino IDE

## Hardware

-> 4 male to male jumper cables.

-> The ESP32 and its extension.

-> A light and a switch.

-> 3 220k ohm's resistor.



## Circuit Diagram



-> Connect the circuit according to the reference given below

## Procedure

-> After connecting the circuit, then connect the usb of the laptop then we need to select the Esp32 Wrover Module and select the port that is connected to. I had already done this.








-> Now write the program

-> After writing the program then we need to compile or verify the program ny clicking the tick mark on top left conner

-> Now we need to upload the written code into the esp32 by clicking arrow mark which is side to the tick mark.

-> Now we can check the by clicking the button on the button on the board to control the light.









## Result

-> By clicking the button the light turn on's and again clicking the button the light turn off's. 

-> In this picture the light gets turn on.
