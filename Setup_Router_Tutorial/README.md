# Description

Configuring the router is primarily done to generate our own IP address. Among many other routers with advanced configurations that are available in the market,  my  professor recommended the GL.iNet Mini Smart Router because of its adaptability, portability, and affordability. I already had experience setting up the router at my home which helped my task easier right now.

# Gear it up

When I opened the router's box, I realized that we need to plug in the power cable to the box before connecting the cable to any USB port on a laptop. Two buttons found on the left side; one is a reset button and the other is switch. When the router is experiencing issues, such as forgetting password, you can use the reset button. The switch button can be slided either ways to choose the respective mode. When the router's light start to flick,  go  the wifi settings and look for the name of your router. There is a SSID(GL-MT300N-V2-50d) given on the router which is unique and can be used to differentiate from other routers. The next step is to input the default password, which is located beneath the SSID key. After providing the necessary information we will enter into the network.  Before connecting it to the broadband network, we can create a new SSID and password.

# Set-up


To setup the router we need to browse the url: http://192.168.8.1 or if you are using different router you can follow the setup guide given by that company. After entering the url in the bowser it will take you to a login page. Initial step is to select the prefered language and create an admin password for the GL-iNet account. It then redirects to the admin panel page, you can see a Wireless section on the left hand side where you can a give a new SSID and password of your network. In my case I named my SSID as jaswanth_iot and password  **** and click apply for the changes to reflect. Later the network gets disconnected and you need to login again with your new SSID and password to connect your network. 
Next step is to connect the router to the broadband network. For this you need to go to the Internet section where you can see 4 modes for connectivity such as using Cable(WAN), Repeater mode, Tethering and 3G/4G modem. You can use any type of connection among the listed ones. I decided to choose the Repeater mode.
In the Repeater section you will see a scan button with underline, click on it to search the networks that are present in your area. You can see the name of your wifi, select it and enter your personal network password so that the router connects to the main wifi. In order to confirm your network has proper connection or not, you can either refer to wifi settings or by playing any content on youtube or by browsing.
