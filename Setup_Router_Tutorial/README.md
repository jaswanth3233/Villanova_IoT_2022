# Description

Configuring the router is primarily done to generate our own IP address. Among many other routers with advanced configurations that are available in the market,  my  professor recommended the GL.iNet Mini Smart Router because of its adaptability, portability, and affordability. I already had experience setting up the router at my home which helped my task easier right now.

# Gear it up

When I opened the router's box, I realized that we need to plug in the power cable to the box before connecting the cable to any USB port on a laptop. Two buttons found on the left side; one is a reset button and the other is switch. When the router is experiencing issues, such as forgetting password, you can use the reset button. The switch button can be slided either ways to choose the respective mode. When the router's light start to flick,  go  the wifi settings and look for the name of your router. There is a SSID(GL-MT300N-V2-50d) given on the router which is unique and can be used to differentiate from other routers. The next step is to input the default password, which is located beneath the SSID key. After providing the necessary information we will enter into the network.  Before connecting it to the broadband network, we can create a new SSID and password.

# Set-up

To set up the router, go to http://192.168.8.1 or, if you're using a different model, refer to the setup instructions provided by the manufacturer. You will be directed to a login screen after entering the url in the browser. Choosing a preferred language and setting up an admin password for the GL-iNet account are the first two steps. It then redirects you to the admin panel page, where you can change your network's SSID and password in the Wireless area on the left. I named my SSID as jaswanth_iot, password **** and click the "Apply" button for the changes to reflect. Later, when the network is disconnected, you must login using your new SSID and password to connect your network. 
The router must then be connected to the broadband network. You must navigate to the Internet area to find  for four connectivity options, such as using cable (WAN), repeater mode, tethering, and a 3G/4G modem. Any one among the connections on the list can be used. I made the decision to use the Repeater mode.
To search the networks that are present in your area, click the scan button with an underline that is located in the Repeater section. To connect the router to the personal wifi, search for your wifi name, and type your unique network password. You may further check your wifi settings, play any content on YouTube, or simply browse to see if your network is connected properly or not.
